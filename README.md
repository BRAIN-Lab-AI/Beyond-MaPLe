# [Deep Learning Project Template] Enhanced Stable Diffusion: A Deep Learning Approach for Artistic Image Generation

## Introduction

Multimodal prompt learning has emerged as a powerful technique to enhance vision-language models, enabling improved generalization in zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks. In this project, we build upon the MaPLe framework (Multimodal Prompt Learning) by introducing three key enhancements:

1. **Prompt Dropout** â€“ to regularize shallow prompts and reduce overfitting.
2. **Smarter Prompt Initialization** â€“ using average CLIP text embeddings of class names for semantic anchoring.
3. **Selective Prompt Injection** â€“ limiting prompt tokens to key transformer layers (1, 6, and 11) for better efficiency.

Our approach, dubbed **Beyond MaPLe**, is implemented and evaluated across 11 public datasets (excluding ImageNet and StanfordCars due to size constraints). Experiments demonstrate consistent improvement in novel class accuracy while preserving or slightly improving harmonic mean scores.

This project was completed as part of the ICS590 Deep Learning course at KFUPM.

## Project Technicalities

### Terminologies
- **Vision-Language Model (VLM):** A deep learning model that jointly understands images and text by aligning them in a shared feature space.
- **CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining):** A foundation model trained on image-text pairs using contrastive loss, enabling zero-shot classification.
- **Prompt Learning:** A technique where learnable tokens are prepended to inputs (text or image) to guide model behavior without updating the entire backbone.
- **Multimodal Prompting:** Applying prompt learning in both the text and image branches of a vision-language model (e.g., MaPLe).
- **Shallow vs. Deep Prompts:** Shallow prompts are applied to the input layer; deep prompts are inserted at intermediate transformer layers to influence multi-level representations.
- **Prompt Dropout:** A regularization technique that applies dropout to learned prompt embeddings during training, helping prevent overfitting.
- **Prompt Initialization:** The strategy used to initialize prompt tokens (random, repeated, or semantically derived).
- **Selective Injection:** Injecting prompts at chosen layers (e.g., layers 1, 6, 11) of the transformer to control the depth of influence and efficiency.
- **Base-to-Novel Generalization:** The model's ability to transfer knowledge from seen (base) classes to unseen (novel) classes during testing.
- **Zero-Shot / Few-Shot Learning:** Evaluation settings where the model has never (or barely) seen examples from the target classes.

### Problem Statements
- **Problem 1:** Prompt-based vision-language models like CLIP rely on static, hand-crafted prompts, which limit performance in domain-specific or novel class settings.
- **Problem 2:** Even with learnable prompts (as in CoOp or MaPLe), generalization to unseen classes often lags behind performance on base classes.
- **Problem 3:** Uniform injection of prompt tokens across all transformer layers introduces unnecessary complexity and redundancy without guaranteed gains.

### Loopholes or Research Areas
- **Prompt Generalization:** How can we better transfer prompt knowledge from base to novel classes without overfitting?
- **Semantic Anchoring:** Can we initialize prompts in a more meaningful way to align with actual class semantics?
- **Injection Efficiency:** Are all transformer layers equally important for prompting, or can we selectively choose optimal ones?

### Problem vs. Ideation: Proposed 3 Ideas to Solve the Problems
1. **Prompt Dropout:** Introduce dropout during training on prompt embeddings to reduce overfitting on base classes and improve robustness.
2. **Smarter Prompt Initialization:** Replace random or repeated initialization with averaged CLIP text embeddings of class names to semantically ground the prompts.
3. **Selective Prompt Injection:** Instead of prompting all layers, only inject prompts at layers 1, 6, and 11 â€” balancing representational depth and efficiency.

### Proposed Solution: Code-Based Implementation

This repository builds upon the official MaPLe framework for multimodal prompt learning. Our implementation focuses on lightweight, modular enhancements to prompt injection, initialization, and regularization.

The core solution includes:
- **Prompt Dropout:** Introduced during training to reduce overfitting on base classes and encourage better generalization.
- **Smarter Prompt Initialization:** Prompt tokens are initialized using the average CLIP embedding of class names, ensuring better semantic grounding.
- **Selective Prompt Injection:** Prompt tokens are injected only at selected transformer layers (1, 6, 11) to optimize representational depth and computational efficiency.

### ðŸ”§ Key Components

- **`maple.py`**: A self-contained file that implements the proposed enhancements to the MaPLe framework. This script modifies prompt dropout, initialization, and layer injection logic.

The rest of the implementation relies on the [official MaPLe GitHub repository](https://github.com/muzairkhattak/maple), which provides the full backbone, dataset utilities, and training pipeline.

## Model Workflow
The workflow of the Enhanced Stable Diffusion model is designed to translate textual descriptions into high-quality artistic images through a multi-step diffusion process:

1. **Input:**
   - **Text Prompt:** The model takes a text prompt (e.g., "A surreal landscape with mountains and rivers") as the primary input.
   - **Tokenization:** The text prompt is tokenized and processed through a text encoder (such as a CLIP model) to obtain meaningful embeddings.
   - **Latent Noise:** A random latent noise vector is generated to initialize the diffusion process, which is then conditioned on the text embeddings.

2. **Diffusion Process:**
   - **Iterative Refinement:** The conditioned latent vector is fed into a modified UNet architecture. The model iteratively refines this vector by reversing a diffusion process, gradually reducing noise while preserving the text-conditioned features.
   - **Intermediate States:** At each step, intermediate latent representations are produced that increasingly capture the structure and details dictated by the text prompt.

3. **Output:**
   - **Decoding:** The final refined latent representation is passed through a decoder (often part of a Variational Autoencoder setup) to generate the final image.
   - **Generated Image:** The output is a synthesized image that visually represents the input text prompt, complete with artistic style and detail.
